## Content
 
 - /Libraries : contains helpful libaries; in particular Libraries/nmfbook-master/ contains the code of the NMF toolbox from https://gitlab.com/ngillis/nmfbook/ 
 
 - /demos : contains demo files that produce tables and figures.

 - main.m : codes that allow to run desired demos.
 
 - /Utils : contains helpful files and MatLab routines to run the demos.


## Demo file
 
 A demo is available. To proceed, please type "1", "2" or "3" when running the ```main.m``` file.
 
 ## Tuning the parameters
 
 There are several parameters that you can choose:
 - The ranks r's of the deep decomposition
 - The number of iterations for the init stage and the proposed Algorithms 1 and 2
 - The accuracy for the computation of the optimal Lagrangian multipliers for MU to respect normalization constraints,
 - Parameters for ADMM procedure from Algorithm 2: rho, threshold and maximum number of iterations. Here, we allow the user to consider a new accelerated version of the ADMM procedure, see flag "options.accADMM"
 - Parameters for min-volume: \alpha_tilde helps to setup the weights \alpha_l  for the min-vol regualirzations terms. \alpha_tilde vector corresponds to the initial and desired ratio between the min-vol terms w.r.t. to the general objective function.

 
For benchmarked approaches, the parameters have been tuned according to the original works.
 
  
  ## Reproduce figures and results from the paper
  
  To do so, you need to run the ```main.m``` file. Here, a menu is available and allows you to choose which figure or table you want to generate. Each number in the table below corresponds to a set of figures.
